# Base Code for Lab Assignment 5

In this lab assignment you will write Active Record queries on the model layer 
of the Ticket Shop application, based on fixture data (sample data), automatically 
generated by means of a predefined task that is available. 

Please proceed with the following steps:

* Take a careful look at the models and their associations.
* Then head to the `lib/tasks/model_queries.rb` file and look at the 
  example query in the `model_queries` task.
* Run the rails console and start writing the queries that are required.
* Once you are done writing a query add a demonstration case to the 
  above `model_queries.rb` file.
* Make sure you add, commit and push your changes.
